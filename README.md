# mux_demux
Just run make, two programs are going to get created one that multiplexes 
and one that demultiplexes 

run ```make```

## requirements
1. make
2. python3
3. gcc

## execution
When make runs it creates a new data.h that includes an array of characters of 640 in length.
Each byte is represented in decimal and also each decimals has a representation in utf so that we
can display on the demux the characters.
